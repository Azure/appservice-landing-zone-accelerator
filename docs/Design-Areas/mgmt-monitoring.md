# Management and Monitoring
## Design Consideration
- Be aware of [App Service limits](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#app-service-limits). Scale up or use multiple App Service instances to scale beyond those limits. [Automate the scale-out and scale-in](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/autoscale/autoscale-best-practices#manual-scaling-is-reset-by-autoscale-min-and-max) with auto-scaling rules. Performance testing should be completed prior to gain a proper understanding of sizing and instance count for the [App Service Plan](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview-hosting-plans)
- Availability Tests help to determine when your app service is not reachable. 
- For App Service Environments, consider configuring [Upgrade Preference](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/environment/using-an-ase#upgrade-preference) if multiple environments are used. 
- Consider using Linux as operating system for more effective cost management.
- Alerts are a proactive way for you to identify and begin troubleshooting problems before you hear from the user, but can also can contribute noise to the environment. 

## Design Recommendation 
- Use [Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) or another Application Performance Management solution to monitor  and learn how your application behaves in different environments.
    - For different environments collect telemetry data into different Application Insights instances.
    - If your application has multiple components separated into different services but you would like to examine their behavior together, then collect their telemetry data into same Application Insights instance but label them with different cloud role names.
    - Export Application Insights data to an [Azure Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview) Workspace. A single Workspace for the organization is recommended.
    - Include operational dashboards in application and feature design to ensure the solution can be supported in production.
    - Implement health checks for your endpoints and use them for health probes, dependency checks and availability tests.
- For stateless app services, disable ARR Affinity
- For a high-level overview of your app serviceâ€™s performance, use Azure Monitor [Dashboards](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/visualizations#azure-dashboards)
- Use the [built-in application monitoring](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/azure-web-apps) 
- Use [AutoHeal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/azure-web-apps) (proactive or custom) to gather helpful data for performance or stability issue
- Configure centralized log management solution and integrate your app services to send logs there
- Enable [diagnostic logging](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/troubleshoot-diagnostic-logs). But take care to performance/load test any such logging settings in a pre-production environment before deploying to production. For example, Failed Request Tracing has been known to induce a negative performance hit under various circumstances. Therefore it's generally recommended to only enable this in production when troubleshooting a specific issue where this logging may help.
- Ensure that every defined alert also has a defined response.
- Use deployment slots for resilient code deployments and to avoid unnecessary Worker restarts (some triggers include content deployment, app setting changes, VNet integration configuration changes, etc.)
- Use [run from package](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/deploy-run-package) to avoid deployment conflicts.
