# App Service Landing Zone Accelerator

This repository encompasses both enterprise architecture guidelines and a reference implementation for deploying Azure App Service solutions in multi-tenant and App Service Environment scenarios. It includes best practices, considerations and deployable artifacts for implementing a common reference architecture.

## Enterprise-Scale Architecture

The enterprise architecture is broken down into six different design areas, where you can find the links to each at:
| Design Area|Considerations|Recommendations|
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Identity and Access Management|[Design Considerations](/docs/Design-Areas/identity-access-mgmt.md#design-considerations)|[Design Recommendations](/docs/Design-Areas/identity-access-mgmt.md#design-recommendations)|
| Network Topology and Connectivity|[Design Considerations](/docs/Design-Areas/networking.md#design-considerations)|[Design Recommendations](/docs/Design-Areas/networking.md#design-recommendations)|
| Management and Monitoring|[Design Considerations](/docs/Design-Areas/mgmt-monitoring.md#design-consideration)|[Design Recommendations](/docs/Design-Areas/mgmt-monitoring.md#design-recommendation)|
| Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery|[Design Considerations](/docs/Design-Areas/BCDR.md#design-considerations)|[Design Recommendations](/docs/Design-Areas/BCDR.md#design-recommendations)|
| Security, Governance, and Compliance|[Design Considerations](/docs/Design-Areas/security-governance-compliance.md#design-considerations)|[Design Recommendations](/docs/Design-Areas/security-governance-compliance.md#design-recommendations)|
| Application Automation and DevOps|[Design Considerations](/docs/Design-Areas/automation-devops.md#design-considerations)|[Design Recommendations](/docs/Design-Areas/automation-devops.md#design-recommendations)|

## Enterprise-Scale Reference Implementation

In this repo you will find reference implementations with supporting Infrastructure as Code templates. More reference implementations will be added as they become available. [User guide](/docs/README.md) goes into details on how to deploy each reference implementations to your subscription.
